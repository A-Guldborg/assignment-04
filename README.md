Implement and test the `IItemRepository`, `ITagRepository`, and `IUserRepository` interfaces using the rules from *Assignment #3*.

You must use an in-memory database and dependency injection for testing.

## Software Engineering

### Exercise 1

Consider a file system with a graphical user interface, such as Macintosh’s Finder, Microsoft’s Windows Explorer, or Linux’s KDE. The following objects were identified from a use case describing how to copy a file from a floppy disk to a hard disk: File, Icon, TrashCan, Folder, Disk, Pointer. Specify which are entity objects, which are boundary objects, and which are control (interactor) objects.

### Exercise 2

Assuming the same file system as before, consider a scenario consisting of selecting a file on a floppy, dragging it to Folder and releasing the mouse. Identify and define one control (interactor) object associated with this scenario.

### Exercise 3

Arrange the objects listed in Exercises SE.1-2 horizontally on a sequence diagram, the boundary objects to the left, then the control (interactor) object you identified, and finally, the entity objects. Draw the sequence of interactions resulting from dropping the file into a folder. For now, ignore the exceptional cases.

### Exercise 4

From the sequence diagram Figure 2-34, draw the corresponding class diagram. Hint: Start with the participating objects in the sequence diagram.

## Submitting the assignment

To submit the assignment you need to create a .pdf document using LaTeX containing the answers to the questions and a link to a public repository containing your fork of the completed code.

Members of the triplets should submit the same PDF file to pass the assignments. Make sure all group names and ID are clearly marked on the front page.
